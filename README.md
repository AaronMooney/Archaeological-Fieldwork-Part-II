# Archaeological Fieldwork application
The application concept is to develop an application to support the exploration of hillforts. The users are archeology students. The app should contain a list of hillforts each student has been assigned to visit. The users are to visit each site and take photos and notes which augment the information on the hillfort provided by the app. Students can add additional hillforts which may be uncharted.
