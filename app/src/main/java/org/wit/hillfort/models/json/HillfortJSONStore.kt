The landmass measures c. 36m N-S by c. 25m E-W and projects S into the Atlantic from the mainland at an altitude of 20m OD. Westropp notes that the name ÇRathmoylan\u0090 is Çnot that of the promontory-fort, but of a ring-fort further inland, from which the townland is named\u0090 (1914, 211). The headland is defended by an earthen bank (Wth 7.5m; int. H 1m; ext. H 2.8m) and external ditch (D 1.3m). Moore observes that an external berm separates the ditch from a modern field bank (1999, 68). There is no recorded entrance to the interior of the site and there are no internal features such as hut-sites."

Waterford. The headland once incorporated ÇSheep Island\u0090 projecting SE from the mainland into the sea at an altitude of 26m OD, but this stack is currently being heavily eroded and is inaccessible from the land. Westropp noted an oval hut site within a grass-covered enclosure on it (1914-16, 221-2) in the early twentieth century (elements of which are visible on satellite imagery). On the mainland, two lengths of rampart meet at a right angle, cutting off the adjacent promontory. The W section consists of an earthen bank (Wth 6m by 2m ext. H) now only 65m in length, while the E section, which is similarly constructed but with a berm between the bank and ditch, is about 100m in length. The external ditch measures 3.8m in width at the base with a depth of 1.4m. An outer bank described by Westropp is not evident (Moore 1999, 67). An entrance c. 6m in width and causeway are also interpreted as being modern in date and not original features. There are no recorded internal features within the enclosed area on the mainland, which has evidently been significantly reduced in size by erosion since first appearing on OS maps."

It is cut off on the landward side by a 40m ditch running in a NE-SW direction across the neck of the promontory. The ditch measures 0.5m in depth and 5m in width and Westropp records a 'spring and stream in its eastern reach' (1914-16, 210). A central causeway measuring 2.7m in width crosses the ditch. An inner bank (c. 4m in Width) described by Westropp as '10 feet to 12 feet wide, once 5 feet to 6 feet higher than the fosse' has since been removed. He notes that Çthe works were dug away partly to make fences along the dangerously crumbling precipices\u0090 (1914, 210). Furthermore, he observed that a recent fire had cleared the interior of the site and no hut-sites were evident. The site is currently overgrown."

Outer earthworks marked on the first edition OS six-inch map to the NW had been levelled prior to 1906 when described by Wesropp (1906, 252). Headland enclosed on the N (landward side) by an external ditch measuring 13.4m in length by 3.8m in depth, a central earthen bank (Wth 7m; H over inner ditch 5.9m; H over outer ditch 3.1m) and internal ditch (Wth at top 9.2m; Wth at base 2.9m; D below exterior 4.1m). Entrance through the bank is thought to be modern in date (Westropp 1914-16, 218). A bank measuring 1.6m in height surrounds all sides of the promontory. Two possible hut sites are recorded in the interior of the promontory, both circular (int. dims. 5.2m by 4.1m; 7.8m by 6.9m). The headland is currently under pasture and is suffering badly from coastal erosion."
